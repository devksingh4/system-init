# Ansible Playbook for Workstation Configuration
Ansible Playbook to configure my workstation as I like it

To run this playbook: 
`sudo apt install -y ansible && sudo ansible-pull -U https://github.com/devksingh4/system-init.git`

This playbook will then run once every 30 minutes, only running the actual tasks if changes were made
